Handling Emojis, Short, Ambiguous, or Mixed Reviews:

1. **Emojis:** 
   - e.g., üòç, üò°, üò¢, ü§Æ often amplify emotional tone and should be interpreted accordingly 
      - Example: üòç ‚Üí Excitement or Happiness, üò° ‚Üí Anger, ü§Æ ‚Üí Disgust.

2. **Short Reviews:**
   - If short and mildly positive or polite (e.g., "Good", "Fine", "Nice") ‚Üí `Happiness`
   - If short but emotionally strong or enthusiastic (e.g., "Sooo good!", "Fantastic!!!", "Awesome!") ‚Üí `Excitement`
   - If thankful (e.g., "Thanks!") ‚Üí `Gratitude`
   - If clearly negative (e.g., "Bad", "Awful") ‚Üí Use tone/context:
     - Anger: "Bad support!"
     - Sadness: "Bad, I expected more"
     - Disgust: "Bad smell"
   - If ambiguous, emotionless or functional (e.g., "It's okay", "Works") ‚Üí `Neutral`.

3. **Mixed or Contradictory Sentiment:**
   - Use **dominant emotional tone** over the full review.
     - "Excited to try it, but it broke" ‚Üí `Sadness`
     - "Amazing product, but regret not buying sooner" ‚Üí `Happiness`
   - If equally strong positive and negative emotion ‚Üí `Neutral`

4. **Ambiguous or Sarcastic Reviews:**
   - Disambiguate sarcasm and irony by intent/tone:
     - "Thanks for wasting my time." ‚Üí `Anger` (blame) or `Disgust` (moral disapproval)
     - "Lovely packaging, if only it worked." ‚Üí `Sadness`
   - If the review contains both praise and disappointment, use tone, punctuation, and final sentiment to guide classification.


Linguistic Cues:

- **High Emotion Indicators**:
   - Exclamations (`!`), all caps (`SO GOOD`), elongated words (`Sooo good`), emojis
   - Excitement often contains energetic punctuation, repeated emphasis

- **Negations**:
   - "Not happy", "Not bad", "Not the best" ‚Üí Invert or soften sentiment
   - "Not terrible" = Neutral or Mild Disappointment

- **Context-Dependent Negative Words**:
   ‚û§ Some negative words appear in multiple categories ‚Äî classify using **surrounding context**, not the word alone:
   - **"Poor" or "Bad"**:
     - `Anger`: "Poor support, I'm angry!"
     - `Sadness`: "Poor quality, I expected more"
     - `Disgust`: "Poor hygiene, smells awful"

   - **"Terrible" or "Awful"**:
     - `Anger`: "Awful service, never again!"
     - `Disgust`: "Awful smell, can't stand it"

   ‚û§ **Rule**: Never classify by keyword alone ‚Äî check tone, surrounding adjectives, emotional intensity, and review intent.

üß© Emotion Overlap and Disambiguation Rules:
- `Happiness` vs `Excitement`: If the tone is calm, content, and emotionally satisfied ‚Üí Happiness. If energetic, surprised, or overjoyed with high emotional arousal ‚Üí Excitement.
- `Gratitude` vs `Happiness`: If the user acknowledges or thanks someone (e.g., seller, service) ‚Üí Gratitude. If expressing personal joy or satisfaction ‚Üí Happiness.
- `Anger` vs `Sadness` vs `Disgust`: Use the dominant cue:
   - Blame/confrontation ‚Üí Anger
   - Regret/disappointment ‚Üí Sadness
   - Moral/sensory violation ‚Üí Disgust
- `Neutral` vs Weak Positives/Negatives: Use Neutral for bland, functional, or polite but emotionless content. Don‚Äôt assign emotional labels unless intensity or tone is evident.


Final Instructions:
- Always return only the **dominant** emotion (no multi-labels).
- Do not speculate or "average" the emotion ‚Äî use judgment from emotional tone, keywords, and context.
- Your label must be **only one of**:
  `Happiness`, `Excitement`, `Gratitude`, `Anger`, `Sadness`, `Disgust`, or `Neutral`

Output your answer as:
Emotion: <one of the 7 emotion labels>
Confidence: <0.00 - 1.00> 'Confidence score should reflect how strongly the review matches one emotion category in tone and context, and how clearly the emotional cue is expressed'.
